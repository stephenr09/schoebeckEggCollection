# schoebeckEggCollection

Background:<br>
  At the University of Wisconsin - Stevens Point in the Museum of Natural History, there is a egg collection of 100+ eggs. As part of an 
  Independent Study course, I and two other classmates were tasked with designing an interactive exhibit for the collection. We decided to   create an application that when given input through the keypad or speech, pulls up the info for the bird that was requested. The user can   search through the collection either through a numerical keypad or through using a speech recognition software. 

Contributions to project:

  •	Implementing 80-90% of the HTML and CSS<br>
  •	Implementing the Web Speech API to allow users to search using voice<br>
  •	Creating the functionality of the keypad<br>
  •	Creating the methods to search for the bird information based in given input<br>

Only has info for birds 1 & 2
  - Project didn't get all of the information implemented due to Covid-19 during the semester
